    "The analysis will guide you through the complete data science workflow, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Definition** – Define the forecasting goal: predicting next-day electricity prices using historical data, demand patterns, and external factors (e.g., weather, holidays). Establish evaluation metrics such as **MAE, RMSE, MAPE**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Collection & Overview** – Load and inspect datasets containing historical electricity prices, generation, demand, and weather information. Understand the structure, relationships, and key features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyze price trends, daily/weekly patterns, seasonal effects, and correlations between electricity demand, weather, and prices. Visualize insights with plots.\n",

    "# **About Electricity Price Forecasting Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity prices fluctuate rapidly throughout the day, influenced by factors such as **demand**, **weather conditions**, **fuel costs**, and the availability of **renewable energy sources** like wind and solar. Predicting these prices is essential for ensuring stability, optimizing energy usage, reducing costs, and enabling smarter grid management.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern energy systems, accurate forecasting plays a key role in helping both providers and consumers make informed decisions. Energy companies rely on forecasts to determine when to buy or sell electricity, while consumers and businesses can adjust consumption to take advantage of cheaper prices or avoid expensive peak periods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because electricity **CAN NOT be stored easily**, unlike fossil fuels (gas,oil,coal etc.) it must be produced (or bought) the moment it is needed. This means supply and demand factors have an **immediate** impact on price, making forecasting a challenging yet vital task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective electricity price prediction has several important applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimizing electricity storage** and battery usage.  \n",
    "- **Enabling demand-side flexibility**, helping buildings reduce consumption during expensive periods (and increase during low or negative price periods).  \n",
    "- **Reducing carbon emissions**, since electricity price often correlates with carbon intensity of generation.  \n",
    "- **Supporting grid stability**, reducing strain during peak hours and balancing supply and demand efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Problem Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to establish a clear understanding of the forecasting challenge. This creates the foundation for the entire project and ensures all further work stays aligned with the primary objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "Develop an **electricity price forecasting system** that predicts **day-ahead electricity prices** using historical price data, generation and demand patterns, weather variables, and other relevant features.  \n",
    "The system should generate accurate forecasts that support smarter decision-making for energy providers, grid operators, and end users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scope**\n",
    "The analysis focuses on electricity market data, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Historical electricity prices** — day-ahead and intraday market values.  \n",
    "- **Energy generation data** — renewable and non-renewable production levels.  \n",
    "- **Weather data** — temperature, solar irradiance, wind speed, etc.  \n",
    "- **Demand/load data** — total electricity consumption patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions will be based on the dataset provided, with optional integration of external weather or market data in advanced stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stakeholders**\n",
    "- **Energy Providers / Traders:** Optimize buying and selling strategies to reduce risk and increase profitability.  \n",
    "- **Grid Operators:** Improve load balancing and ensure efficient grid stability.  \n",
    "- **Businesses & Industries:** Adjust operational schedules to lower electricity costs.  \n",
    "- **Consumers:** Reduce electricity bills through smarter usage patterns.  \n",
    "- **Data Scientists / ML Engineers:** Explore forecasting algorithms and improve model accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Success Criteria**\n",
    "A successful forecasting system should produce **accurate, reliable, and robust predictions**, assessed using metrics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMSE** — Root Mean Squared Error  \n",
    "- **MAE** — Mean Absolute Error  \n",
    "- **MAPE** — Mean Absolute Percentage Error  \n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics measure how close the predicted prices are to real future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A clearly defined problem enables the development of a powerful and effective electricity price forecasting model that supports smarter, greener, and more efficient energy systems."
