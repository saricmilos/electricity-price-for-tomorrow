# Electricity Price Forecasting System  
**Machine Learning for Day-Ahead Price Prediction**

## Overview
Electricity prices fluctuate constantly due to factors like demand, weather, renewable energy availability, and fuel costs. Being able to **predict tomorrow’s electricity prices** is essential for:

- Energy companies optimizing buying/selling strategies  
- Grid operators improving stability and demand balancing  
- Businesses reducing operational energy costs  
- Consumers adapting usage to save money  
- Supporting the transition to renewable, low-carbon energy systems  

This project builds a complete **Electricity Price Forecasting System** using a combination of:  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Machine Learning (ML) models   

The goal is to generate accurate **day-ahead forecasts** based on historical data.
